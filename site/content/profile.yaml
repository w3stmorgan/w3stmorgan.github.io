  about: |
    Some things you're good at. Some things are good for you. For me, programming is both. That's why I love programming and why I always seek to provide value with it.

    I am open to open-source projects, if you're looking for contributors I would be happy to help. Please don't hesitate to reach out to me if you have any question, want to hire me for a freelance project or even seeking a mentor.
